OOPs

Example:

Waiter class can many objects such has "Henry" , "Angela"

has: attributes modelled by variables
    is_holding_plate = true
    tables_responsible = [1,2,3]

does: methods modelled by functions
    deliver_food():
    collect_cash():
    take_order():

 class name CarBlueprint() naming should be like this

 [Object] = class
 car = CarBlueprint()
