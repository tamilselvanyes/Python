If the component is not packed or placed or grid
it won't be visible


Pack:

Place the component in the screen from the top by default

Place:
Precise positioning(absolute positioning)
.place(x=100, y=100) coordinate system

Grid:

Divides the page into number of rows and columns
.grid(row=0, column=0)
if the grid is not filled in the lowest level even if
you give higher numbers for row and column it will be
placed in the lowest level first

Hence you have to fill the lowest levels first


You can't use pack and Grid together, these are incompatible
with each other
